What Is My Purpose?

A. To find out the best festive sales for a credit card, eithr xmas or indepence day

How Did I Do This?

A. In any hypothesis testing the process flows in a true or false manner. we all know that two sample T test performed when we have 2 discrete values as inputs and if we want to find a output which is continous. So, at first I tried to convert each respective column into an individual array and verified if the data followed normal distribtuion. if it followed then i had perfomred a shapiro test to check the p-value > or < 0.05. If it is > 0.05 it follows the normal distribution. Now we check the means of the indivudal employee through the stats.ttest_ind funciton to find out which has the highest value of p to make a decision
